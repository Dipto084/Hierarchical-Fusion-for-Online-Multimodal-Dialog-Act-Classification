Mr. Posner|You have a very impressive resume, Ms. Green. I especially like what I see here about implementing a new filing system.|s|s|s|/home/messal944084/Desktop/Dialogue-Act-Classification-main/EMOTyDA/train_splits_audio/dia640_utt0.wav

Joanna|It certainly did brighten up the inside of the filing cabinets.|ans|ans|ans|/home/messal944084/Desktop/Dialogue-Act-Classification-main/EMOTyDA/train_splits_audio/dia640_utt5.wav
Rachel|Well, they uh, they-they do more than that.|ans|ans|ans|/home/messal944084/Desktop/Dialogue-Act-Classification-main/EMOTyDA/train_splits_audio/dia640_utt6.wav

Rachel|Yes, Joanna really has been an incredible mentor to me.|ag|ag|ag|/home/messal944084/Desktop/Dialogue-Act-Classification-main/EMOTyDA/train_splits_audio/dia640_utt8.wav
Joanna|Oh. And Rachel has been really incredible in getting my morning bagel for me. It¬ís amazing how she gets it right almost|s|s|s|/home/messal944084/Desktop/Dialogue-Act-Classification-main/EMOTyDA/train_splits_audio/dia640_utt9.wav

Mr. Posner|Yes, that¬ís very good. Now a uh, big part of this job is cultivating personal relationships, especially with designers.|ag|ag|ag|/home/messal944084/Desktop/Dialogue-Act-Classification-main/EMOTyDA/train_splits_audio/dia640_utt12.wav
Rachel|Yes, I realize that|ag|ag|ag|/home/messal944084/Desktop/Dialogue-Act-Classification-main/EMOTyDA/train_splits_audio/dia640_utt13.wav
Joanna|And Rachel shouldn¬ít have any problem with that. The only problem might be getting a little too friendly, if you know what I mean.|s|s|s|/home/messal944084/Desktop/Dialogue-Act-Classification-main/EMOTyDA/train_splits_audio/dia640_utt14.wav
Rachel|I love working with designers!|s|s|s|/home/messal944084/Desktop/Dialogue-Act-Classification-main/EMOTyDA/train_splits_audio/dia640_utt15.wav
