Phoebe|Come on, you know, Thanksgiving. Ooh, you got the bigger half. What'd you wish for?|q|q|q|/home/messal944084/Desktop/Dialogue-Act-Classification-main/EMOTyDA/train_splits_audio/dia793_utt0.wav
Joey|The bigger half.|ans|ans|ans|/home/messal944084/Desktop/Dialogue-Act-Classification-main/EMOTyDA/train_splits_audio/dia793_utt1.wav
Chandler|I'd like to propose a toast.|o|o|o|/home/messal944084/Desktop/Dialogue-Act-Classification-main/EMOTyDA/train_splits_audio/dia793_utt2.wav
Chandler|Little toast here, ding ding.|s|s|s|/home/messal944084/Desktop/Dialogue-Act-Classification-main/EMOTyDA/train_splits_audio/dia793_utt3.wav
Chandler|I know this isn't the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting.|o|o|o|/home/messal944084/Desktop/Dialogue-Act-Classification-main/EMOTyDA/train_splits_audio/dia793_utt4.wav
Chandler|Anyway, I was just thinking, I mean, if you'd gone to Vail, and if you guys'd been with your family, if you didn't have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn't be all together, you know?|o|o|o|/home/messal944084/Desktop/Dialogue-Act-Classification-main/EMOTyDA/train_splits_audio/dia793_utt5.wav
Chandler|So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked.|s|s|s|/home/messal944084/Desktop/Dialogue-Act-Classification-main/EMOTyDA/train_splits_audio/dia793_utt6.wav
