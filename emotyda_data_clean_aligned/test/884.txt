Chandler|Look, Joey, Kathy is clearly not fulfilling your emotional needs.|o|o|o|/home/messal944084/Desktop/Dialogue-Act-Classification-main/EMOTyDA/train_splits_audio/dia884_utt13.wav
Chandler|But Casey, I mean granted I only saw the back of her head, but I got this sense that she¬ís-she¬ís smart, and funny, and gets you.|s|s|s|/home/messal944084/Desktop/Dialogue-Act-Classification-main/EMOTyDA/train_splits_audio/dia884_utt14.wav
Joey|You got all that from the back of her head?|s|s|s|/home/messal944084/Desktop/Dialogue-Act-Classification-main/EMOTyDA/train_splits_audio/dia884_utt15.wav
Chandler|All right look, I think it¬ís time for you to settle down. Y'know? Make a choice, pick a lane.|o|o|o|/home/messal944084/Desktop/Dialogue-Act-Classification-main/EMOTyDA/train_splits_audio/dia884_utt16.wav
